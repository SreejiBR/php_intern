Exercise 3: File Upload and Management System

This project is part of my PHP internship, designed to build a file upload and management system with essential file operations.

Overview: This is a PHP web application that allows users to upload, view, edit, delete, and search text files, with file storage on the server.

Key Features:

1. Developed a file upload feature where users can upload text files, which are then stored on the server.


2. Added functionality to display the contents of uploaded files directly on the webpage for easy viewing.


3. Implemented edit and delete features, allowing users to modify or remove uploaded files.


4. Added a search feature to quickly locate specific files.
