# Exercise 3: File Upload and Management System

This project is part of my PHP internship, designed to build a file upload and management system with essential file operations.

## Overview
This is a PHP web application that allows users to upload, view, edit, delete, and search text files, with file storage on the server.

## Key Features

1. **File Upload**: Developed a feature where users can upload text files, which are then stored on the server.
2. **File Display**: Added functionality to display the contents of uploaded files directly on the webpage for easy viewing.
3. **Edit and Delete**: Implemented features that allow users to modify or remove uploaded files.
4. **Search**: Added a search feature to quickly locate specific files.
