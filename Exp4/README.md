# Exercise: Order Management System

This project is part of my PHP development practice, designed to build an order management system with essential features for managing product orders.

## Overview
This is a PHP web application that allows users to add products, view an organized summary of orders, and manage product quantities in real time, with data stored in sessions.

## Key Features

1. **Product Addition**: Developed a feature that enables users to add products with name, quantity, and price, which are stored in the session for ongoing orders.
2. **Order Summary Display**: Added functionality to display an organized table of all added products for easy viewing.
3. **Edit and Delete**: Implemented options allowing users to adjust quantities for each product or delete individual items from the order summary.
4. **Clear Orders**: Added a feature to clear all items from the order in a single click, resetting the session data.
5. **Real-Time Price Calculation**: Integrated real-time updates for product totals and the grand total, providing users with instant feedback on the overall cost of their order.
