# PHP Internship Projects Repository

This repository contains a series of exercises completed during a PHP internship, each designed to build core skills in PHP and MySQL development.

## Overview
This repository includes the following exercises:

- **Student Registration System**: A form-based application to register and manage student information in a MySQL database.
- **User Authentication System**: A signup and login system with session-based authentication, user profile management, and security validations.
- **File Upload & Management**: A file-handling application that allows users to upload, edit, delete, and search text files stored on the server.

Each exercise folder contains its own `README.txt` file, which provides a detailed breakdown of the exerciseâ€™s features, setup, and database structure.

## Purpose
The goal of these projects is to reinforce backend skills in PHP, focusing on data handling, user authentication, and file management.
